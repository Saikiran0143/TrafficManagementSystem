Developed a Traffic Management System for paying challans, aimed at streamlining the process of traffic fine payments. This system integrates with traffic databases to identify violators and automatically generate challans for traffic rule infractions. It features a user-friendly interface for drivers to view and pay their fines online, reducing the need for in-person visits to traffic offices. The system includes secure payment gateways, real-time updates of payment status, and detailed records of transactions. By automating fine generation and providing convenient payment options, the system enhances efficiency, reduces administrative burden, and promotes timely compliance with traffic regulations.
